# the-next-big-thing :rocket:
Ignite a world of endless possibilities.

Humanity thrives on ideas.

Every few millennia, there blooms an idea deep within the global human subconsciousness that promises radical change.

Change that promises hope.

Change that redefines the limits of innovation.

Change that ignites a world of endless possibilities.

We discovered fire 🔥

We discovered the wheel 🤸

It's time to discover ourselves ❤️

The flow of time may be linear, but its perception exists in ebbs and flows. The world fluctuates between periods of booming progress, and those of painful lethargy.

Does the eagle dream of soaring higher than the highest cloud? We may never know, for we are not eagles.

These are some of the questions that keep me up at night.

A moment comes but rarily in history, when an age ends, and the soul of innovation, long suppressed, finds utterance.

This is one such moment.
